# R6-Siege-Image-Recognition
Rainbow Six Siege Image Recognition model. Made with Pytorch. Recognizes the images from the game (ranging from Weapons, Characters to Maps etc.)
Still a work in progres. Data is king so it's more about gathering data/references (by googling or playing the game) and training the model.
